# A simple solar panel placer

Question: Describe one or more approaches you would take to writing a computer program that automatically lays out a set of rectangles of equal, known sizes, on a larger rectangle of a defined size, avoiding obstacles (e.g. a "no-go-zone" rectangle) on the larger rectangle?

This program finds all possible placements of a set of rectangular solar panels with similar dimensions on a large container while avoiding "no-go-zones". It randomly generates the obstacles for now.
